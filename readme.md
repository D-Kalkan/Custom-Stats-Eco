## Description ##

This is a series of modifications made to the Eco+ Server files to facilitate a series of more strict game style we aim to support for the server.

### Main Features ###

* White Tiger contributed the calorie and recipe changes to food. (All are much harsher)
* All skill book recipes replaced to make 10 skill scrolls and are x10 the material cost
* Rebalanced the material cost of all skill scroll recipies to use a wider range of research papers
* Rebalanced several additional recipes that are dependent on cooked food
* Added new crush rock recipes for gneiss & basalt
* Tweaked a few additional recipies to line up with the age system
